# How to Install and Upgrade ULogViewer

## ðŸ’» Installation
ULogViewer is built as portable package. Except for Windows 7, you can just unzip the package and run ULogViewer executable directly without installing .NET Runtime.

### Windows 7 User
You need to install [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.1+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) before running ULogViewer.

### Ubuntu User
If you want to run ULogViewer on Ubuntu (also for other Linux distributions), please grant execution permission to ULogViewer first. If you want to create an entry on desktop, please follow the steps:
1. Create a file *(name)*.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications. ex, ~/.local/share/applications/ulogviewer.desktop.
2. Open the .desktop file and put the following content:

```
[Desktop Entry]  
Name=ULogViewer  
Comment=  
Exec=(path to executable)
Icon=(path to AppIcon_128px.png in ULogViewer folder)
Terminal=false  
Type=Application
```

3. After saving the file, you should see the entry shown on desktop or application list.

Currently ULogViewer lacks of ability to detect screen DPI on Linux, so you may find that UI displays too small on Hi-DPI screen. In this case you can open ```Application Options``` of ULogViewer, find ```User interface scale factor``` and change the scale factor to proper value. If you found that scale factor doesn't work on your Linux PC, please install ```xrandr``` tool then check again.

## ðŸ“¦ Upgrade
ULogViewer checks for update periodically when you are using. It will notify you to upgrade once the update found. Alternatively you can click "Check for update" item in the "Other actions" menu on the right hand side of toolbar to check whether the update is available or not.

ULogViewer supports self updating on Windows and Linux, so you just need to click "Update" button and wait for updating completed. For macOS user, you just need to download and extract new package, override all existing files to upgrade.
